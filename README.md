# CS260CFinalProject

**GOAL AND MOTIVATION**
The goal of our project was to build an emotion recognition model that would generalize well across different language data. To do this, we wanted to investigate if there exists a connection between linguistic characteristics and the performance of our model. We examined data from language branches, which linguists group based on shared features in structure (compound word usage, word order, etc.) and history. Because of the shared language structure, our hypothesis was that models trained on languages in one language branch will generalize well to other languages in that same branch. Currently, datasets for emotion recognition from multiple languages are small, and we hoped that exploring linguistic relationships would allow us to create bigger datasets with languages under the same language branch.
